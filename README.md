# CarbonCap
Carbon Cap is a software designed to help homeowners in the UK reduce their carbon footprint by providing a one-stop-shop for energy sustainability. The UK government has set a target of reducing household carbon emissions by 3.7 metric tonnes by 2030. This means that the average home should produce 4.5 tonnes of CO2 annually instead of the current average of 8.1 tonnes. Carbon Cap aims to achieve this goal by making it easy for homeowners to make changes that reduce their carbon emissions.

The home is a microcosm for carbon emissions in the UK, and Carbon Cap recognizes this by centralizing current energy-saving features such as smart meters. However, Carbon Cap does not stop there. It has several features that augment energy consciousness, profile homeowners to gamify the energy-saving process, use AI to predict energy usage and cost, and provide home automation.

One of the main features of Carbon Cap is its ability to profile homeowners and gamify the energy-saving process. Carbon Cap uses data from smart meters to create a profile of the homeowner's energy usage. The software then creates energy-saving challenges that are tailored to the homeowner's energy usage profile. The challenges are designed to be fun and engaging, making it easier for homeowners to reduce their energy usage.

Carbon Cap also uses AI to predict energy usage and cost. The software analyzes data from smart meters and other sources to predict how much energy a home will use in the future. This helps homeowners plan their energy usage and reduce their energy bills. Additionally, Carbon Cap provides home automation features that allow homeowners to control their energy usage remotely. This is particularly useful for homeowners who are away from home for extended periods.

The system is low cost and can easily be implemented in homes. Carbon Cap is designed to work with existing smart meters and other energy-saving devices, which means that homeowners do not need to invest in expensive hardware. The software is also designed to be user-friendly, which means that homeowners can start using it right away without any special training.

In conclusion, Carbon Cap is a software that provides a one-stop-shop for energy sustainability in the home. It centralizes current energy-saving features such as smart meters and provides additional features to augment energy consciousness, profile homeowners to gamify the energy-saving process, use AI to predict energy usage and cost, and provide home automation. The software is low cost and can easily be implemented in homes, making it an effective tool for reducing household carbon emissions in the UK. By using Carbon Cap, homeowners can make changes that will help the UK meet its national ESG goals.

The homepage has been optimized to fit the Raspberry Pi screen perfectly, which means it may not be fully visible on other devices.
